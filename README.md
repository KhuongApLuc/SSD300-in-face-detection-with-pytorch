# SSD300-in-face-detection-with-pytorch
Using SSD300 for face detection problem: Check is there any face in the image, if label is '1' (yes) => draw bounding boxes

<p>- Test model with image in run.py<br>
- Test model in realtime in Run_in_Realtime.py</p>

<p>- Model is trained by Wider_Face, how to get data is present in load_model.py<br>
- Data preprocessing is deployed in data_preprcessing.py<br>
- Create model in model_pretrained.py without loading weights</p>

<p> - Hardware: Cuda - Nvidia GeForce GTX 3050Ti - Linux Ubuntu<br>
- Training: 100 epochs, batch_size=8<br>
- Framework: Pytorch</p>
